#  JavaFX Currency Converter  
A polished desktop application built in **Java + JavaFX** that enables intuitive currency conversion between 20 international currencies, featuring an elegant UI, usage-aware smart tips, and a clean modern UX.

---

##  Overview  
This project goes beyond a simple currency calculator — it includes usage analysis that *learns from the user’s behavior*.  
The system simulates AI-like intelligence by:

- Recognizing frequently used currency pairs  
- Suggesting common conversions  
- Warning on high-value transfers  
- Detecting redundant same-currency conversions  

All of this is implemented **offline** with internal logic — no API or Internet required.
